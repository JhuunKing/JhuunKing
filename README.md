- Hey there! 

- Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Juno :)

ðŸŒŸ A little bit of me

- I caught the coding bug early on, when i was around the age of 14. I started learning game development and my first engine was Unity and  then i started learning Unreal Engine. This led me to dive into the world of C++ and C#, where I discovered the joy of bringing ideas to life through code.

ðŸ“š My life now

- I'm a university student focusing on System Development, my GitHub will be a snapshot of my coding ventures, from personal projects to the latest insights I'm gathering.

ðŸŒ± My plans

- I'm excited to collaborate, learn, and contribute. This GitHub is a space where my ideas take shape, and i'm excited to see where this will lead me.

Thanks for dropping by! ðŸ‘¾

~ Juno
